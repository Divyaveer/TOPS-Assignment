Q. What is Software? What is Software Engineering?

A. Software is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a 
   computer to perform specific tasks or functions. Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing
   , and maintaining software using systematic methods and practices to ensure its reliability and quality.

Q. Explain types of software.

A. Software types include:

   1. Application Software
   2. System Software

Q. What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.

A. SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured approach used to develop high-quality software. The phases of SDLC are:

    1. Requirements Gathering: Collecting and understanding user requirements to define the scope of the project.

    2. Analysis: Analyzing gathered requirements to create a detailed system specification.

    3. Design: Designing the software architecture, database structure, and user interfaces.

    4. Implementation: Developing the actual code based on the design specifications.

    5. Testing: Thoroughly testing the software to identify and fix any defects or issues.

    6. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or the production environment.

    7. Maintenance: Regularly updating and improving the software to meet changing needs and fix bugs.

    The SDLC ensures a systematic and efficient development process, resulting in reliable and effective 
    software solutions.

Q. What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart.

A. DFD stands for Data Flow Diagram. It is a graphical representation that shows 
   how data moves through a system, depicting the flow of data and processes that manipulate it.
